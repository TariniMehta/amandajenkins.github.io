    <article>
        <p>With her clipboard in hand and her neon green safety vest on, Amanda Jenkins calls out to a gray-bearded man sweeping the road at the Castro Street homeless encampment located under Richmond Parkway.</p> 
        <p>“Will you fill out this survey?” she asks, handing him a pen and paper. “It’s for our meeting in Sacramento next month.”</p>
        <p>Surrounded by trailers and old cars covered with blue tarp and billboard posters (“they’re great at keeping the rain out - you’d only know if you’ve lived outside!”), she makes her way to the next person she finds at the quiet encampment.</p> 
        <p>He is busy loading big black bags of trash onto a truck when she greets him with a fond punch in the shoulder and rattles off the questions on the survey.</p>
        <p>“How long were you homeless?” “Where do you live?” “Do you think every citizen should get universal basic income?”</p>
        <p>He answers. She jots down. Well-versed with the uncertainty of life on the streets, Jenkins is a volunteer leader for non-profit <a href="https://fiaeastbay.org">Faith in Action East Bay </a>and is collecting responses from current or formerly unhoused individuals ahead of an April public meeting with California legislators about housing rights.</p>

        <p>She asks Castro Street residents several questions, but not their names. Those she already knows. Between 2020 and 2021, Jenkins was herself a resident of the Castro Street encampment, spending every night in her gray Nissan Maxima with bright red tape for tail lights. The Castro residents are not her clients, she says. They’re her people.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>In a city that knows homelessness all too well, 42-year-old Amanda Jenkins is an authority on the subject. She serves on the City of Richmond’s Castro Street Advisory Council, which meets once a month on Zoom to discuss the encampment’s sunset plan. Earlier this month, she was invited to a three-day conference organized by the National Alliance to End Homelessness in Oakland, an event for which she colored her hair red and blue - “patriotic colors to show this is our land”, she explains. Not long ago, she set up her own non-profit called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/operation.ground.0/"> Operation Ground Zero </a>-- a “stepping stone to better things” for homeless people, Jenkins says. For all this work, her qualifications are six years of lived experience on the streets - in trailers, tents and cars; behind Triangle Court, on Castro Street, and at Rydin Road, the vehicle and trailer encampment that the City of Richmond cleared out last fall.</p>
        <p>Her ultimate goal, Jenkins says, is to run a transitional housing set-up for the homeless community – and, one day, to be elected Mayor of Richmond. “I want to be remembered as someone who helped my people,” she says.</p>
        <h2 id="subhead1"> BEING UNHOUSED </h2> 
        <p>With temporary city and county support, Jenkins lives in an apartment now, a two-bedroom central Richmond place she shares with her 15 year-old son Clyde and two dogs, Bobo and Legacy. It is the first time she has lived indoors, with a private bathroom and kitchen, since 2016.</p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Back then, she was in a Section 8 apartment in Richmond with her abusive boyfriend of four years and “just hustling to survive,” she says, while her five kids lived in and out of the care of her mother in Pinole. The Section 8 program enables the payment of rental assistance to private landlords on the behalf of low-income people.</p>
        <p>She left that apartment, she says, when the landlord paid her to break the lease early because they wanted to redo the complex. “But really, I think they asked me to leave because my partner was beating the crap out of me and they couldn’t help,” she says.</p>  
        <p>At the time, Jenkins says, she chose not to apply for a new Section 8 voucher and look for a house because she was afraid her partner would track her down.</p> 
        <p>“That’s pretty much why I became homeless,” she says. She filed police reports, she says, but nothing helped. She flitted from a friend’s place to an abandoned house, and then to several tents she made, with whatever scraps of material she could find, and pitched in different parts of north Richmond.</p>
        <p>“Being in that tent showed me I could do anything in the world,” she says. “I could move the whole thing in 20 minutes!” She chuckles, and then goes quiet. </p> 
        <aside class="pquote">
            <blockquote>
                <p>“But nobody should have to live like that. In the rain, I see a person in a tent and I start crying. It’s horrible. It’s nothing I would wish on my worst enemy, especially for a woman. That’s why I have dogs, you know.”</p>
            </blockquote>
        </aside>
        <p>Jenkins says her ex-boyfriend kept following her, and once even tried to set fire to her tent. She moved her tent 28 times in six months, she says, until one day she got on her knees and prayed for whatever was holding her back in her life to be removed. </p>
        <p>Not long afterward, Jenkins was told her ex-boyfriend had died - she doesn’t know how, but, she says she felt she could breathe again. “I told myself I would never allow someone to take my joy of life again,” she says. “Because life is precious. And it’s gone before you know it.” </p>
        <h2 id="subhead2"> FINDING JOY </h2> 
        <p>Jenkins did find joy within the unhoused community, she says; she came to love a man called BoomBoom, who moved into her tent. He was too heavy to walk and suffered a great deal of pain, she says. Although he had been promised housing, it never came through, she adds.</p>
        <p>"I ended up taking care of him for about a year in the tent," Jenkins says.  "And he died on me. Before he died, he said, 'Amanda, you take your white skin and your big mouth and get everyone inside. They’ll never see you coming to defend us Black people because you’re white.' And I said --" she is fighting back tears -- "Okay.”</p>
        <p>In 2020, spurred by repeated requests from the police to move her home (a trailer at that time) and motivated by BoomBoom’s words, Jenkins suggested to an officer that she take all the campers in north Richmond and get them together at one spot. </p>
        <p>“I told him if you don’t like my idea, just act like you didn’t hear it because I’m going to do it anyway. And he said it was a really good idea,” she says. That’s how the encampment located at the tail-end of North Castro Street, what she calls ‘Camperland,' came to be.</p>
        <h2 id="subhead3"> RIDIN' IT OUT AT RYDIN </h2> 
        <p>But a year later, Jenkins says, she herself had to leave Camperland when a misunderstanding resulted in a man “socking” her. So she packed her life into her beat-up Maxima and moved six miles away to Rydin Road, where another homeless encampment had emerged during the pandemic. </p>
        <p>Rydin Road was a smaller community - 28 residents as compared to Castro’s 74 - and they bonded like one big family, or at least that’s how they remember it now. They cooked meals together on the back of a car, they borrowed from and lent each other essentials, they depended on each other. </p>
        <aside class="pquote">
            <blockquote>
                <p>"It’s just like being neighbors, but a little closer, because we went through things like not having toilets together,” Jenkins says.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </aside>
        <p>But multiple incidents of arson, issues of safety and blight and a return to post-Covid normalcy put the Rydin Road and Castro Street encampments on the Richmond city council’s radar. </p>
        <p>In April 2021, the City of Richmond contracted non-profit <a href="https://hceb.org">Housing Consortium of the East Bay </a> to provide services to and prepare transition plans for the people of Rydin Road so it could be cleared. A total of $250,000 was allocated to enable these transitions to shelters, motels, rooms with family and friends or other housing alternatives. </p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>After more than a year of planning, the Rydin Road encampment was cleared on September 30 last year. Multiple teams from the City of Richmond - community development, abatement, police and contracted non-profits - were on ground as bulldozers destroyed most vehicles and the stuff inside them. A few cars that were arguably still in working condition - that includes Jenkins’ Maxima - were towed away to a yard nearby.</p>
        <p>“It was really planned for the City,” says Jenkins. “They knew exactly what they were doing and were working in unison. But we were scrambling. It was complete chaos for us.”</p>
        <p>They were primed for this day; but can you really ever be prepared to see your house - whatever that may mean - destroyed? Everyone was crying, Jenkins says, as they tried to collect their belongings and get out of there. </p>
        <p>Jenkins stayed till the very end, she says, she watched it all happen.</p>
        <p>The transition funds, divided among the Rydin Road residents according to their individual moving plans, came to more than $8,000 per person. The money allocated to Jenkins went into putting her and her 15-year-old son up at a Motel 6 for two and a half months, after which she finally got a Section 8 voucher through the county and moved into the place she now calls home.</p>
        <h2 id="subhead4"> BEING HOUSED </h2> 
        <p>The first-floor apartment costs her $200 per month, supplied by the City of Richmond’s long-term rental assistance program Housing First, which prioritizes former Rydin residents. But, Jenkins says, the transfer of money has been slow, creating a new source of stress for her. </p>
        <p>“They were three months behind,” she says. “I had to get an eviction notice before the City finally paid my rent.” </p>
        <p>This month, too, there’s no guarantee the rent money will be in on time. Jenkins says she’s told City officials that she can’t afford for it to be late again, so they tried calling her property manager to explain the situation. “But he already said he doesn’t care,” she says. “He wants his rent.”</p>
        <p>The apartment is warm and cozy and filled with mismatched pieces of furniture Jenkins says she has found on the streets: light gray recliner, two black high chairs, a long white sofa. Thanks to Bobo and Legacy, they’re all covered in dog hair. A  poster on the wall warns: “Complimentary PET HAIR upon entry. You’re welcome.” </p>
        <p>The living room walls are covered with other quotes she’s put up – “Be Loving.” Be Humble.” “Be Patient.” “Bloom from Within."</p>

        <p>Tucked away behind a white wooden door is a tiny closet Jenkins has converted into an office. The two top shelves are filled with an impressive Hello Kitty collection - little ones, big ones, stuffed toys, a snow globe, pencils, a pillow, a bag; all pink. On the bottom shelf are her notes and papers. You’re looking at the Operation Ground Zero headquarters. </p>

        </figure>
        <h2 id="subhead5"> WORKING FOR OTHERS </h2> 
        <p>Operation Ground Zero is a group Jenkins put together to help homeless people get on their feet. It started as a volunteer effort to ensure the Rydin Road and Castro Street encampments were as clean, safe and serviced as possible. Jenkins encouraged residents to work in tandem with other nonprofits that had the same goals at the two encampments. As Operation Ground Zero volunteers, they took on duties of security, trash collection and cleaning in their living space. </p>
        <p>Now, Operation Ground Zero is a registered non-profit in California with a 501(c)(3) tax exemption and bigger goals. </p>
        <p>“We want people to lean on us when they need it the most,” she says. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLFN-XfeYXw">Drake song</a>, the organization's slogan is “Started from the bottom, now we’re here”.</p>
        <p>The organization currently has no money and just a few volunteers - all currently or recently homeless, Jenkins says. She's using her smartphone and the internet to learn how to apply for grants. She is exploring opportunities to collaborate with other nonprofits and the City of Richmond in the homelessness effort. She’s also taking online certificate courses in leadership and social work and attending all city council meetings to remain in the loop.</p>
        <p>“Let us help,” she says. “Taking care of homeless people is rocket science for the City. But we already know this stuff. We know what needs to be done. They don’t need to spend money on consultants - we’ll tell them for free. Our training is our lived experience. While the City people slept in their beds after work, we were still at Rydin Road every single night.” </p>
        <h2 id="subhead6"> WHAT NEXT? </h2> 
        <p>After Rydin Road, the Castro Street clear-out is next on the City of Richmond’s agenda. The encampment is set to shut in June this year. For the same, the City is using its Encampment Resolution Funding of  $4.8 million from the California Interagency Council on Homelessness, housing manager Jesus Morales says. </p>
        <p>“The plan is to transition all residents from the Castro encampment to a housing choice with rental assistance and wrap-around services to help them get to self-sustainability,” he says. </p>
        <p>It’s a sunny afternoon and Amanda Jenkins is busy filling out surveys at the Castro Street homeless encampment while her dog Legacy waits in her beat-up Maxima, barking ever so often to demand her attention. </p>
         <figure>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>She needs to hurry up - she has a doctor’s appointment in 30 minutes. But before she can get going, someone calls out to her - “Amanda, how do we get paid for our RVs if we give them up?” </p>
        <p>A man stops her to give her a Hello Kitty-themed Scrabble he found discarded - he knew she’d want it, he says. </p>
        <p>A woman in a yellow ‘Security’  t-shirt - the only person Jenkins doesn’t recognize at the encampment - asks, “Are you here to help with housing? I live in my car.” Jenkins tells her she should consider going to the women and children’s shelter nearby. “God bless you, sister. I appreciate you,” the woman replies. </p>
        <p>Now, Jenkins is really running late. Shouldn't she get going? Won't she miss her doctor's appointment? She looks over and smiles. “I won’t stop till everyone has a house," she says. "I can’t.”</p>
